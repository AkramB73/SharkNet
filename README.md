# SharkNet

SharkNet is a project that utilises reinforcement learning to simulate the behavior of a shark agent in a dynamic marine environment. The agent is trained using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to learn how to navigate, find food (chlorophyll) and maintain its energy levels while considering environmental factors like sea surface temperature and ocean currents.
